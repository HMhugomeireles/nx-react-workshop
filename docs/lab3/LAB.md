### 💻 Lab 3 - Executors

###### ⏰ Estimated time: 5-15 minutes

We'll build the app we just created, and look at what executors are and how to customize them.

#### 📚 Learning outcomes:

- Understand what a `target` and `executor` are
- Invoking executors
- Configure executors by passing them different options
- Understand how an executor can invoke another executor

#### 📲 After this workshop, you should have:

#### 🏋️‍♀️ Steps:

1. Build the app

   </details>

2. You should now have a `dist` folder - let's open it up!
   - This is your whole app's output! If we wanted we could push this now to a server and it would all work.
3. Open up `workspace.json` and look at the object under `projects/store/architect/build`
   - this is the **target**, and it has an **executor** option, that points to `@nrwl/web:build`
   - Remember how we copied some images into our `/assets` folder earlier? Look through the executor options and try to find how it knows to include them in the final build!
4. Send a flag to the executor so that it builds for production

   <details>
   <summary>🐳 Hint</summary>

   `--configuration=production`

   </details>

5. Open up the `dist` folder again - notice how we now generated a `3rdpartylicenses.txt` file, as per the "production" configuration in `workspace.json`
6. The **serve** target (located a bit lower in `workspace.json`) also contains a executor, that _uses_ the output from the **build** target
   - so we can just re-start `nx serve store` see the new styles you added!
7. Inspect what changed from the last time you committed, then commit your changes
